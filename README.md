Objective:\
-Create own classifier to distinguish spam emails from ham (non-spam) emails.\
-Evaluation of model based on the model's accuracy.

Summary:\
-Split data into training and validation set.\
-Created a visualization that showed meaningful information about the data used to select features for a logistic regression model.\
-Used feature engineering to create features to train the model.\
-Trained model using those features.
-Results:\
Training set accuracy = 0.969\
Validation set accuracy = 0.957\
Overall accuracy on unseen data of 1,000 rows = 0.957
